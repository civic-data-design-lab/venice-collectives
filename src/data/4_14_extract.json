		"description": "Arcosanti’s story begins as Italian-American architect Paolo Soleri’s urban planning concept. Coined as a prototype ‘arcology’, Arcosanti explored the possibilities of densely populated but ecologically low-impact human habitats. The 25-acres of land in Paradise Valley, Arizona was first purchased in 1956 while the physical construction began in 1970. It was projected to house 5000 residents.\\n \\nThe 80 residents (dubbed “Arconauts”) that live there now earn minimum wage by working 40 hours a week for the Cosanti Foundation, a non-profit organization. They keep the city running by working in grounds maintenance, construction or administration. The foundation provides workshops to teach Paolo Soleri’s ideas as well as exist as a tourist attraction, offering services such as tours, overnight stays, cafes, and conferences – about 40,000 tourists visit yearly. Arcosanti also supports itself with the production of Soleri Windbells, ceramic and bronze bells made on-site.\\n \\nFor a $75 weekly fee, residents are also provided food discounts alongside unlimited access to housing, utilities, and facilities, such as a swimming pool and music library. In order to formally become a member and permanently live at Arcosanti, prospectives must submit a letter of intent to the community council and complete a multi-week workshop that includes assisting with building renovations and infrastructure upgrades.\\n \\nAlthough Arcosanti and its community still exists today, with Soleri’s resignation and eventual passing, the languished construction, and rapidly developing technology elsewhere, the site remains as a pipe dream.",

		"description": "Located in southern India, Auroville, the “City of Dawn,” was founded by Mirra Alfassa (The Mother) in 1968. It was initially conceptualized as a self-governing town without money, private property, or a hierarchy and was focused on the spiritual evolution of its residents, many of whom have migrated from outside India. It aims to become a model of the ‘city of the future’. The Charter of Auroville specifies that its residents must be “willing servitor(s) of the Divine Consciousness” who live in a place of “unending education, of constant progress, and a youth that never ages.”\\n\\nIn the master plan for Auroville, the city is laid out as a galaxy. At the center is a striking structure called the Matrimandir, the “soul of Auroville.” Four zones radiate out from the Matrimandir -- the Industrial in the North, the Cultural in the Northeast, Residential in the South\\/Southwest, and the International in the West. A Green Belt surrounds the city area.  \\n\\nThe community of Auroville, which includes people living in much more affluent conditions than those in the surrounding villages, continues to grapple with the clash of the concept of utopian living with the realities of living in a world of inequality. \\n",

The community is comprised of more than 2,900 people living in 23 settlements on four continents. The members renounce individual property to practice radical discipline in the spirit of the first church in Jerusalem.\\nThis effort was created by the Protestant theologian Eberhard Arnold and his family as a way to seek answers to the devastation after World War I. What started as a small group of Christians rapidly grew into a community of over 100 members. However, during World War II they were threatened by Nazis to leave Germany, for they refused National Socialism. This defiance forced them to reestablish themselves in England, and later on, Paraguay.\\nMembership in the Bruderhof is for life and achieved by taking vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Economics are a common good; no member receives a paycheck, stipend, or allowance from the church community. Once someone has become a member, all of their earnings and inheritances are given to the church community, and each receives necessities such as food, clothing, medical care, and housing according to need evaluated by an appointed steward.\\nThe Plough, the community’s own publishing house, brings profits from the multiple books and magazines that have been released since the Bruderhof’s beginning. These earnings are then used for spreading the gospel, building up and sustaining community life, carrying on educational work, offering hospitality to visitors, and giving aid to the needy.\\n",

These meetings have a democratic structure with committees allocated to different tasks. Collaboratively, this community aims to develop a local cooperative economy that makes basic needs such as food, water, and health care, accessible to everyone. \\nAll members are a part of what are known as The Common Projects which are autonomous projects fueled by an effort to protect self-management from the effect of the bank and the State. These projects range from hackerspaces to organic farms that have the purpose to disrupt industries and welcome in open cooperatives.\\nECOcoops, the local electronic currency created by the CIC, are used for exchange within the community and are not convertible to Euros. Although all members have access to basic income of both ECOcoops and Euros, the members value and address the needs of people above everything and contribute according to what is possible for them. Currency is viewed as exchange between people in the community, and informal exchange such as free economy, direct exchange and community economy are heavily promoted. This shift in values eliminates the the goal of accumulating money that is fundamental to capitalism.",

The emergence of kibbutzim was driven by Jewish community’s desire to re-establish a national spirituality and identity which emphasized an ideal model of social equality, self-sacrifice, and connections to the land. \\n\\nIn the late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century, escalating violence in Europe instigated the large-scale migration of the Jewish communities to the Palestine region. Amongst these displaced Jewish people are mostly atheist young adults with strong values and ideals that conflicted with the environment they grew up in. They sought new identities and often embraced models of socialism to overturn the old way of life. A.D. Gordon, a spiritual leader in the early Jewish communities, preached redeeming Jewish souls through agricultural and manual labor. \\n\\nThe earliest form of Kibbutz is Degania, which was founded in 1909 as a small collective agricultural settlement between the southern shore of Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River. A larger kibbutz, Ein Harod, was built by two hundred people in 1921 near Mount Gilboa. These communities were founded on principles of communal ownership and direct democracy. They practice drastic measures to reject any forms of possession. Shared homes are assigned upon marriage. Children grew up in communal children houses and were raised not by their own families but by their assigned nannies of their age group. The gender equal and democratic environment fosters influential social activists, politicians and military leaders, both female and male. \\n\\nAs Israel shifted from agricultural economy to industrialized economy, kibbutzim could not keep pace with the change. Eventually, most kibbutzim were merged and privatized. Kibbutzim still exist in different forms today but only about a quarter of them are practicing the traditional model. Despite its decline in popularity, its ideologies represented the purest form of Zionism in Israel and established the foundation of modern Israli society.\\n",

It was started in 1997 as part of a state-wide initiative called the ‘people’s plan for democratic decentralization’. The program breaks female farmers up into groups called sangha krishis, which are units that practice collective farming. Each unit has about five members, and they work on leased land, where they practice organic and sustainable agriculture. This allows them to split the high costs of farming land as well as reap the benefits of their crop, especially during festival season in Kerala. The model allows millions of women across the state to gain independence and autonomy from a society which has historically treated them as second-class citizens, as well as profit off of the agricultural industry-in a country where the farming industry has been in decline for the past few decades. Today, over 4.3 million women are part of the program (which means that close to 60 percent of Kerala’s households have a member in Kudumbashree), and it has been called one of the ‘greatest gender justice and poverty reduction programs in the world’.",

The ring of what would normally be a contiguous block of houses creates a shared backyard that serves a variety of functions. The children of the community are raised as brothers and sisters, which lends an important level of familiarity that improves accountability.

However, they also work in a diversity of other settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes. LVNs are certified to perform a variety of tasks, including feeding, bathing, injections, collecting samples, cleaning wounds, and monitoring medical equipment. Becoming a LVN is one of the quickest ways of becoming a nurse, requiring a high school diploma (or equivalent) and competition of a state-certified program. Once certified, LVNs work under the direction of physicians or registered nurses to give care. The practice can be traced to communities of self-taught individuals who worked in home care, with the first formal training program coming out of the Young Woman’s Christian Association in 1892. The YWCA’s course consisted of a 3 month long session for individuals regarding the care of infants, children, elderly, and people with disabilities. LVNs are important for providing home care to patients who do not require all the treatment skills of professional nurses. As the elderly population rises, so does the population of the country with long term care needs.

It became important in the 18th and 19th centuries as a center of cotton textile manufacturing, with an emphasis on heavy textiles for industrial uses. With the founding of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society in 1844, the town became the birthplace of the cooperative movement. The Rochdale Principles were born out of the meetings of the Rochdale Society. The idea of the co-operative was centered on business owned by its customers with everyone working together towards a common goal. A small number of textile mill workers formed the society, with the hope of serving the community around them with goods they couldn't otherwise individually afford. \\nThe advancement of the Industrial Revolution resulted in many new technologies, and as a result, more and more skilled workers were falling into poverty with the development of new machinery. In 1844, they decided to take a stand in opposition to the ideologies of the Industrial Revolution and began to create the rules for a new cooperative society. The principles were based on the Society's members' collective ideologies. The first two principles consisted of Open Membership and Democratic Control, which meant that the co-operative was open to everyone, with every member having voting power. It would be another 74 years until women achieved suffrage and at the time, only around 1 in 7 men in the UK had the right to vote. Thus their ideologies presented a level of equality that was completely novel in that particular moment.",

As both a market-oriented entity and a commons-based community, Sensorica’s vision is mainly challenged by finding the balance between supporting productions with intrinsic motivations, rather than financial, and making such production economically sustainable. Sensorica’s governance system relies on three systems: the value accounting system, the reputation system and the role system. They collectively evaluate every member’s contributions, incentivize good behaviors, filtering each member to adequate tasks, and incites voluntary subordination. Contributions can be made by participants in the forms of material, financial or time. It is a direct democratic and decentralized organization in the forms of distributed decision making and bottom-up resource allocations. \\n",
